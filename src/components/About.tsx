          <p>
            I'm a graduate student at UC Davis pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
            specializing in Machine Learning and AI. Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Engineer at Optum, 
            UnitedHealth Group, where I engineered HIPAA-compliant healthcare solutions serving 50M+ users.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise spans across AI/ML (RAG systems, deep learning, computer vision), cloud infrastructure 
            (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker), and full-stack development (React, Next.js, Java, Python). I've delivered 
            systems that improved API performance by 30%, reduced deployment time by 60%, and maintained 90% code coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond engineering, I'm passionate about researchâ€”I've published 5 papers on blockchain-healthcare integration, 
            drowsiness detection, and IoT systems. I've earned 8 Diamond Recognition awards at Optum and won international 
            Best Paper awards. I thrive on solving complex problems at the intersection of AI, healthcare, and scalable systems.
