            I am Vandana, a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in full-stack development, REST APIs, 
            GraphQL APIs, and cloud infrastructure. Currently, pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer 
            Engineering at UC Davis, with a focus on scalable Intelligent systems. I am passionate about research 
            in ML and AI, leading to digital health innovation. I enjoy finding smarter ways to make tech accessible, 
            building scalable systems that are secure and impactful.

            Outside work and studies, I enjoy tracking my nutrition, hiking, travelling to new cities and capturing 
            nature. If you are interested in connecting over technology, AI, or digital health innovation, let's 
            talkâ€”I am always open to new ideas and opportunities.
